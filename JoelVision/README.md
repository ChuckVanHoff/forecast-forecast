Web app for image overlap visualization

The whole purpose for this program is to help better visualize the effect on light intensity as the overlap of independent light projections. The specific goal is to help my buddy better wrap his mind around the light footprints across his garden canopy.

Parts:
  -Scrape some images from the web (possibly offer the option to upload images from personal devices)
  -put the images on a webpage
  -make the images 'grabbable' and 'draggable'
  -let their opacity be determined by the number of selected images
  -assign numeric values to specific points on each image that can be combined
  -create a new image of the overlapping images, showing the new light footprint
