# forcast-forcast
Weather collection

This is intended to create a model to predict the errors in the weather prediction models.
The models of the forecasters are created from theory rooted in math/logic, formed in the
image of past observations, and initialized with present observations to create predictions
of future observations.

This model will be formed in a similar way  the actual forecast model; in thisit'll be.
It will, just as the forcasters, develop a model for the behavior of the observed
phenomenon, knowing for certain only the observational data.
